famfamfam world flag icon set, from:
http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/

Flags have been renamed to 3-letter country codes (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3)
and optimized using pngcrush & optipng

The set is missing (probably among with more) flags for the following countries / regions:

AQ, ATA   Antartica      has no official flag, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Antarctica
                         instead we use a unofficial symbol, created from
                         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Antarctica.svg

IM, IMN   Isle of Man    self-governing British Crown Dependency, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_man
                         created icon from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Man.svg

JE, JEY   Jersey         self-governing British Crown Dependency, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey
                         created icon from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Jersey.svg

This is a script that combines all flag icons into one big image in order to reduce
server requests. Since not all flags are yet renamed, this is still disabled.

Test results from 2011-03-08:

  In:  106 images totalling of 39.0 KiB
  Out: 1 image totalling of 26.2 KiB true-color
  pngcrush: 25.9 KiB

  Result file size:
    39.0 - 25.9 = 13.1 KiB savings (33% size reduction)

  Result network bloat reduction:
    In: 106 requests = 106 * 500 = ~ 51.7 KiB (with a average request HEAD of 500 bytes)
    Out: 1 request   =   1 * 500 = ~ 0.5 KiB

    Before: 39.0 KiB + 51.7 KiB = 90.7 KiB
    After:  25.9 KiB +  0.5 KiB = 26.4 KiB

    Savings: 90.7 - 26.4 KiB = 64.3 KiB (huge win!)

  If finally reduceded to 256-color (with somewhat visible loss of quality):
    Out: 9.7 KiB


  XXX: after these tests, I enabled alpha channel and out image grew to 29.4 KiB XXXX should not need full alpha channel for transparent pixels?!??!


TODO
---
* NOT reduce individual icons to 256-color due to some visible loss of image quality
* rename remaining flags in "todo" directory
* start using a flag sprite prodcued by make_sprite.php
