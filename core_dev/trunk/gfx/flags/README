The set is missing (probably among with more) flags for the following countries / regions:

AQ    Antartica    has no official flag, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Antarctica
                   instead we use a unofficial symbol, created from
                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Antarctica.svg

GLP   Guadeloupe   is not official country (belongs to France) but has its own flag.
                   we use a icon created from
                   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Guadeloupe_(local).svg
