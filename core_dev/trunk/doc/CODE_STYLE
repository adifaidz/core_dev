h1. Coding style

* Interface names: start with capital I, like IXHTMLHeader
* Strings named $q always hold SQL queries
* functions curly braces always on separate lines. use separate lines in other cases too where apropriate (for code readability)


h1. File format

* For text files, always use UTF-8 encoding and Unix line ending (LF)


h1. Subversion rules/common sense

* Never checkin non-functional code

Always run/compile your code before a check-in to ensure that it dont produce parse errors/compile errors, in such state as it will break the HEAD codebase for other developers.
When you realize that you did, please commit fix as soon as you possibly can.


h1. Naming rules

Because the code base is cross-languages, often mixed in content, I decided to use the following coding style to make it easier to distinguish code:

For PHP code: functionNamingLooksLikeThis(), andMaybeThis(), andSomethingElse()

For Javascript code: function_naming_looks_like_this()

For XHTML div tag names: container_name, some_object_header

For SQL queries (keywords in caps): SELECT * FROM tblUsers WHERE userId=4
