Autumn 2011 cleanup:

    * link to: chat 1-to-1, see gallery


Messages
    * finish Messages class (drop functions_messages.php)


Guestbook
    * finish Guestbook class (drop functions_guestbook.php)


Friends
    * The "Bookmark" class cant be used, it is more like a "favourite users bookmarks"
    * write a proper Friend class using functions_contacts.php logic (1:send friend request, 2:approve, 3:both persons are friends)
    * write a "friend list" view (for Friend class)


Chat
    * write 1-on-1 chat code (drop functions_chat1on1.php), store messages as normal Message objects
    * need chat rooms (+ ability for admin to create new rooms on the fly)


Gallery
    * drop / rewrite of functions_fileareas.php
    * rather use some nice-looking js image viewer


Moderation
    * ability for a user to report an unappropriate picture, or an abusive user (rewrite of atom_moderation.php)


Forum
    * needed?


DB CHECKER:
    * all classes that is 1-to-1 mapped to a db table should extend from a common class (SqlObject?)
    * do a checker that includes all core/*.php files and iterates over all known classes and finds
        those who extend from SqlObject, and does some special code to compare tbl structure vs class properties
    * add this to the coredev/selftest eventually (?) may be heavy operation; if so use a memcached variable to only do it once in a while?
