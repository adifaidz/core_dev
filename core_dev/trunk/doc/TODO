DB CHECKER:
    * all classes that is 1-to-1 mapped to a db table should extend from a common class (SqlObject?)
    * do a checker that includes all core/*.php files and iterates over all known classes and finds
        those who extend from SqlObject, and does some special code to compare tbl structure vs class properties
    * add this to the coredev/selftest eventually (?) may be heavy operation; if so use a memcached variable to only do it once in a while?


ADMIN:
    * paginate "manage files" view in admin to 50 objects/page or something
