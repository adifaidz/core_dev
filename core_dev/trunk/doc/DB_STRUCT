core_dev provides a abstract object-oriented database layer to allow you to transparently
switch the SQL database backend.

In order to make this work, I have chosen to only use the MySQL syntax in all queries.
Each database backend must implement it's own query rewrite engine in order for it
all to work.

I have tried hard to avoid using MySQL-specific features, but here's a few that is used:

    * The DATETIME type is used excessively
    * LIMIT is used somewhere
    * RAND() is used somewhere

For best result with core_dev, use MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.2 (recommended 2007-12-05, things might
change before I notice this readme is outdated).
