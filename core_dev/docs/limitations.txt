* Wikis
	- "En_artikel" och "En artikel" måste hanteras som densamma


* Unicode-support
	- We chose utf8 as our preferred unicode encoding.
	- Currently uses a number of configure tweaks to enable unicode support across the platform.
	
		Example:
			The php_mysql.dll and php_mysqli.dll extensions on both Windows and Linux run with latin1
			as default charset, regardless of other settings.
			PostgreSQL drivers dont suffer from this problem.
			
			Our solution:
			We force set utf8 encoding at the connect time by mysqli_set_charset() or "SET NAMES utf8"

		PHP 6 will come with full unicode support in the core, so hopefully this can be deprecated soon


* Cellphones
	- Some (older) cellphones have trouble interpreting <form> tags with an empty action="",
		For example the phone model LG U880 (kianos)
		
		Common cellphone resolutions:
			LG U880: 176 x 220 pixels (probably most common cellphone resolution today)
			Nokia N95, Nokia N73, Sony Ericsson M600i, Samsung SGH-U600, Samsung SGH-Z720: 240x320 pixels (new cellphones come with this resolution)
		


* Multi-project server space sharing
	- To enable the same core and admin code work seamlessly over multiple projects,
		certain scripts require the passing around of a 'pr' GET parameter, containing
		the current project path, so the local config.php can be found for /admin/ pages
		for example.
		This parameter is not required to pass around if you set up only one project on a website, like this:

		/admin/				admin files
		/api/
		/core/				core functionality
		/css/
		/js/
		/gfx/
		/					place your project files & config.php here


* XHTML short tags stuff

	These tags passes as valid XHTML according to HtmlValidator firefox plugin, however Firefox dont handle them correctly

	Dont work in browsers: <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/ajax.js"/>
	Correct: <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/ajax.js"></script>

	Dont work in browsers: <a name="xx"/>
	Correct: <a name="xx"></a>

* Debugging

	According to xdebug docs:
	
	"Xdebug does not work together with the Zend Optimizer or any other Zend extension 
	(DBG, APC, APD etc). This is due to compatibility problems with those modules. 
	We will be working on figuring out what the problems are, and of course try to fix those."
	
	Seems to work ok tho, apc & xdebug both latest compiles from http://pecl4win.php.net/
