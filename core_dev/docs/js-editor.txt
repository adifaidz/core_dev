---[[ doc för js-editor features ]]---

	There is a handy js-based toolbar for most edit boxes, exposing many of the bbcodes implemented.
	Just mark the text you want in bold and hit the bold "B" button to apply the bbcode on the marked text.

	The following bbcodes are currently implemented:
	
	[b]bold text[/b]
	[i]italic text[/i]
	[u]underlined text[/u]
	[s]strikethru text[/s]

	[code]program code block[/code]
	[quote]quoted text[/quote]
	
	[h1]headline level 1[/h1]
	[h2]headline level 2[/h2]
	[h3]headline level 3[/h3]

	[hr]			creates a full-page break

	This is implemented in formatUserInputText() in functions_textformat.php

	URL and email handling are automatically translated to clickable links.

	Special Wiki-links:
	
		Example [[wiki:About]] links to wiki.php?Wiki:About
		Example 2: [[wiki:About|read about us]] links to wiki.php?Wiki:About but "read about us" is link text
		Example 3: [[link:page.php|click here]] makes a clickable link

		Note: Wiki-links are currently not exposed by the js-editor toolbar
