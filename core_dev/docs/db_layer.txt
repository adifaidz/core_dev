core_dev provides a abstract object-oriented database layer to allow you to transparently
switch the SQL database backend.

In order to make this work, I have chosen to only use the MySQL syntax in all queries.
Each database backend must implement it's own query rewrite engine in order for it
all to work.

I have tried hard to avoid using MySQL-specific features, but here's a few that is used:

	* The DATETIME type is used excessively
	* LIMIT is used somewhere
	* RAND() is used somewhere

For best result with core_dev, use MySQL 5.0 and PHP 5.2 (recommended 2007-12-05, things might
change before I notice this readme is outdated).


Currently the following database backends are supported:
	* php_mysql.dll - MySQL interface
	* php_mysqli.dll - Improved MySQL interface (preferred one)


These database backends are in W.I.P. status:
	* php_pgsql.dll - PostgreSQL (not properly tested)
	* php_sqlite.dll - sqlite driver (not properly tested)


These are planned:
	* php_mssql.dll - Microsoft SQL Server (will only focus on version 2005 or newer support)
