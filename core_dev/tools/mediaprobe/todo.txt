* move all detected media from /core_dev/projects/mime_types to this repo

* (maybe) use ffmpeg's probe functions directly. if so, perhaps make patches to improve this probing with ffmpeg directly (ps. remember ffprobe)

* Detect image formats:
	- TIFF

* Detect audio formats:
	- WAVE
	- OGG
	- MP3 (is this MPEG container with audio track?)

* Detect video formats:
	- MPEG with video track

* Redo byte reading! read bytes as they are needed & skip bytes etc instead of using a buffer
