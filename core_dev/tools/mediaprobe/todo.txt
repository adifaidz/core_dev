* samples:
	- replace some samples with smaller files
	- more samples at http://samples.ffmpeg.org/

* image formats:
	- TIFF

* audio formats:
	- WAVE
	- OGG

* video formats:
	- MPEG video
	- AVI (need avi container parser)
	- MKV (need mkv container parser)
	- MOV (need mov container parser)

* (maybe) use ffmpeg's probe functions directly.
	if so, perhaps make patches to improve this probing
	with ffmpeg directly (ps. remember ffprobe)

* regularry use valgrind to look for memory leaks:

	valgrind --leak-check=yes ./mediaprobe media/audio_wma.wma
