		- All generated HTML are checked to be 100% "XHTML 1.0 Transitional" compatible using the "HTML Validator" plugin for Firefox.
			* The goal is to be 100% "XHTML 1.0 Strict" compatible.
			* Need to use 1.0 Transitional because strict/1.1 dont support <center>
			* Need to use 1.0 Transitional because strict/1.1 dont support <a href="" target="_blank">

			doctypes:
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

			-moz-border-radius-* (Mozilla-specific) for rounding corners of div boxes
				[x] Firefox 2
				[ ] Opera 9.2
				[ ] Internet Explorer 7

			opacity: 0.7;								/* mozilla + opera?? + ie7??? */
			filter: alpha(opacity=70);	/*ie6*/
				* We use IE-specific rules for alpha-level of div:s

		- Compatiblity
			* The platform are being developed using Firefox 2, but functionality are regularry tested
				in Internet Explorer 7 and Opera 9 aswell.
