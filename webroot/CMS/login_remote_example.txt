Assuming a user is already logged in into your system:

To generate a link which leads the user to uReply in logged in mode,
you do a HTTP GET request (from your server) to:

http://ureply/get_login_code.php?id=38&name=Elvis%20Presley

The ID you send in the GET request is the user ID you have in your existing user database.
"name" is the username which you want to forward into uReply.
The user can later specify a alias in uReply to be shown next to his forum posts if he wants to.

The get_login_code.php script responds with a random number, which is a temporary password for the login to uReply.
Read this number into your script, and use it to generate a new url, which should look like this:

http://ureply/login_remote.php?id=38&r=634608831

You can now present this URL to the user as a hyperlink.

The login ID is temporary. After the user have clicked the link once, a uReply session will be initiated and upkept
by a session cookie, the link will then no longer work to initiate a new session.
If the user later follows the same link, he will be redirected to a uReply page because a session has been initiated,
but if a third party follows the link he will meet only a blank page.

To the end user this will only be a click on a link, and then he ends up logged into uReply.

You can test the integration with your system on these URL's:

http://213.100.91.161:16200/CMS/get_login_code.php
http://213.100.91.161:16200/CMS/login_remote.php
