Plugin for uwrfl, see http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ for more information

wurfl.xml is dated 2007.03.03 and was last updated 2007.05.28

The PHP scripts are based on wurfl_php_tools_21beta2.zip


update_cache.php is a utility to update the cache.
By default the script starts with a die; command, which you need to edit out to use the script.
This is a security precaution.

But you shouldnt need to run update_cache.php, since a generated cache comes with the plugin.
