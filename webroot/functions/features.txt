==== SQL profiler =====
		- Built into the core of the db classes are a accurate profiler that displays
			which queries failed, or how much time each query took to execute.

==== Session handler ====
		- Deals with all things related to users & sessions.
		- Can store variables associated with each user for a variety of uses.
		- Editor to modify/delete user settings, using AJAX

==== Database layer ====
		- Transparent interface to different SQL databases (currently supports php_mysql.dll and php_mysqli.dll).
			(todo: initial support pgsql, mssql)
			Reduce time rewriting already working code for another db driver if you use this well defined class.

==== Wiki engine ====
		- You can easily attach images and other media to a wiki by a simple upload.
		- Every change gets stored in a revision table

==== Standards compatible ====
		- All generated HTML are checked to be 100% "XHTML 1.0 Transitional" compatible using the "HTML Validator" plugin for Firefox.
			* The goal is to be 100% "XHTML 1.0 Strict" or maybe "XHTML 1.1" compatible.
			* Currently need to use 1.0 Transitional because the others dont support <center>
			* Currently need to use 1.0 Transitional because strict/1.1 dont support <a href="" target="_blank">

			XHTML 1.0 Transitional:
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

			XHTML 1.0 Strict:
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

			XHTML 1.1:
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

		- CSS
