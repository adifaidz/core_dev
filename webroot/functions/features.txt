* SQL profiler
		- Built into the core of the db classes are a accurate profiler that displays
			which queries failed, or how much time each query took to execute.

* Session handler
		- Deals with all things related to users & sessions.
		- Can store variables associated with each user for a variety of uses.
		- Editor to modify/delete user settings, using AJAX

* Database layer
		- Transparent interface to different SQL databases (currently supports php_mysql.dll and php_mysqli.dll).
			(todo: initial support pgsql, mssql)
			Reduce time rewriting already working code for another db driver if you use this well defined class.

* Standards compatible
		- XHTML 1.0:
			* Currently need to use Transitional because the others dont support <center>
			* <br /> is not needed, <br/> is ok. Netscape 4 needs a ending space but nobody cares.
