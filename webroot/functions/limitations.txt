* Currently only one DB connection is supported, and must be named to $db
		- Tried to implement db-links internally in different classes so they had to be initialized with a db-handle,
		  to make it possible to use different db connections for different things. But i made a mess out of it
		  and resorted to using "global $db;" for now.
