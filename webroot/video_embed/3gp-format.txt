There are two different standards for this format:
		* 3GPP (for GSM Based Phones, may have filename extension .3gp)
		* 3GPP2 (for CDMA Based Phones, may have filename extension .3g2)
		Both are based on MPEG-4 and H263 video, and AAC or AMR audio.
		
		för "3GPP" så står det "3gp4" eller "3gp5" i headern
		för "3GPP2" så står det "3g2a" i headern

		The fields in the objects are stored with the most significant byte first, commonly known as network byte orde
		or big-endian format. 

.3gp filformatet:

0x0000:		0000 00x1 6674 7970 3367 7034 0000 x200
										f t  y p  3 g  p 4

					x1 = 1C, 14
					x2 = 01, 02
