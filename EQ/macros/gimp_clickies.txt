Clickies
--------
A module that deals with auto refreshing of item clickies.

When the krust macro is running, it will automatically refresh clickies for you.
By default it will refresh manaregen and manapool clickies only.
To get the most out of this module you will need to configure it some.
I have tried to split up clickes by type, so you will just have to activate "resist clickies" for example,
and no matter what resist clicky you might have, they will be auto casted.

This module also take adventage of data from krust_zoneinfo.ini if present.

This module will not refresh clickies under certain circumstances:
A) You are /afk, or invisible
B) You are in a neutral zone (click here for neutral zone listing)
C) Jboots are not refreshed in indoor zones (see krust_zoneinfo.ini)



INI settings for clickies module
--------------------------------
All these settings are read from [Playername] in krust.ini

Turn on clickies by type:
-----------------------------
useClickyResists=1							Refreshes your resist clickies
useClickyAttack=1								Refreshes your attack clickies (slot 1, 3 and 5)
useClickyDS=1										Refreshes your DS clickies (slot 2 and 4)
useClickyHaste=1								Refreshes your haste and overhaste (Haste v3) clickies
useClickyAC=1										Refreshes your AC clickies

In addition, there is a few odd clickies you need to turn on like:
ClickyJboots=1									Refreshes your Journeyman's Boots / Fabled Journeyman's Boots
ClickyBracerOfTheHidden=1				Refreshes your Bracer of the Hidden
ClickyIllusion=item name				Refreshes your illusion clicky
ClickyVoiceOfTheSerpent=1				Refreshes your Voice of the Serpent
ClickyRapierOfSomberNotes=1			Refreshes your Rapier of Somber Notes (bard tacvi clicky)

Example INI section to turn everything on by default:
[Playername]
useClickyResists=1
useClickyAttack=1
useClickyDS=1
useClickyHaste=1
useClickyAC=1
ClickyIllusion=Amulet of Necropotence
ClickyJboots=1
ClickyBracerOfTheHidden=1
ClickyVoiceOfTheSerpent=1
ClickyRapierOfSomberNotes=1


Disabling the module
--------------------
/clickies												Toggles clickies module ON or OFF, if you wish to pause clickies refresh at some point
This change is only for the duration of the script. When script is restarted the setting is forgotten.
Module is turned ON when krust is started


The clickies module also adds some /slash commands to EverQuest to improve gameplay
----------------------------------
/rez														Target a corpse and /rez it with your cleric epic 1.0 (auto equips and clicks it)
/shrinkgroup										Shrinks nearby group members that is not already shrunk with your targetable shrink item (bracelet of the shadow hive and such)
/shrinkself											Shrinks yourself with your shrink clicky
/makepulleritem #ammount				Clicks your "summon puller item" clicky #ammount times (default is 5)
/mount													Casts your mount clicky


List all supported clickies:
	Everything i could dig out of Lucy database + help from forums, up to and including DoDh expansion,
	as of 2006.01.05
 




Compatiblity: This module takes advantage of MQ2Exchange plugin if it is loaded (fixme)

Status: Mostly complete.

Todo:
	* MQ2Exchange support
	* Make neutral zones a INI section
	* Verify the example works stand-alone
	* BuffedAttack* functions return buffname instead of number so we can refresh buffs before they have faded
	* store current ON/OFF mode of /clickies in INI

For developers:
	Exposes ${gimp_clickies_loaded} and ${gimp_clickies_activated} globally

	#define INI_FILE yourinifile.ini
	#include gimp_clickies.inc
	
	/declare UpdateClickiesTimer timer outer 0

	|Put this in your macro's main loop
	/if (!${UpdateClickiesTimer}) {
		/call DoClickies
		/varset UpdateClickiesTimer 60s
	}
