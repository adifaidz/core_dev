	gimp_clickies.inc:

			making the krust.ini.sample actually useful more "out of the box" with the buffrequests module, at least for the classes already
			defined in there, just missing ranger buffs i think.
			This change will make existing ini's work without change, but some people might notice buffrequests starting to work
			if they didn't before.

		  If you have more than one resist clicky, krust will only refresh one of them.
		  I need someone to explain how the two kinds of resist clickies stack.
		  How do the Soul Energy/Eternal Ward/Chaotic Ward/Unliving Ward stack versus Form of Protection I/Form of Protection/Form of Protection III/Form of Protection IV/Aura of Pure Arcanum buffs?
		  I heard they did stack if you clicked them in a certain order or something? Can someone fill me in :)
