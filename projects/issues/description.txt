Overview
========
A flexible yet easy to use issue tracker for
project management and problem report
follow ups.



Dependencies
============
The software will be based on the core_dev
framework, allowing rapid development of
advanced web application features.

* core_dev needs to be enhanced to reliably
	support importing & processing of email
	messages.

* The "userdata" functionality of core_dev needs
	to be enhanced to allow for the creation and
	configuration of fields for the issue reports.



Vocalubarity
============
* A common name for issue tickets needs to be established,
	proposed are: issue ticket, problem report, issue report.



Needs
=====
* Ability for admins to easily customise
	the needed fields of a issue ticket
	through a web interface.
	(This is a weakness of Trac)

* Ability to automatically create issue
	tickets from emails sent to a special
	support email address.
	(This is a weakness of Trac)
